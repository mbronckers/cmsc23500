# cmsc23500 - Databases

In this repo I have included the source files I wrote with my course partner for a project called SimpleDB, a multi-user transactional database server written in Java.

It is a pedagogical project that is part of the Database course at many universities, so many versions and implementations of SimpleDB by various students exist.
